# Master & Tackle In Cloud

Welcome! This repository documents my journey as I pursue cloud certifications:
- **Microsoft Azure:** AZ-204 (Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure)
- **Microsoft Azure:** AZ-400 (Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions)
- **AWS:** Developer Associate

## Approach
For each topic I learn, I will:
1. State the topic and key concepts.
2. Present a real-world business problem.
3. Design a use case and solution using the topic.
4. Document the process step by step.
5. Review the solution using Well-Architected Framework principles.

## Structure
- `AZ-204/` — Azure developer topics and use cases
- `AZ-400/` — Azure DevOps topics and use cases
- `AWS-Developer-Associate/` — AWS developer topics and use cases
- `assets/` — Diagrams, screenshots, and supporting files

## How to Add a New Topic
1. Create a folder for the topic under the relevant certification directory.
2. Add a `README.md` in the topic folder with:
   - Topic name
   - Problem statement
   - Use case description
   - Solution steps
   - Architecture diagram (if any)
   - Well-Architected review
   - Lessons learned

Follow along as I master the cloud, one use case at a time!
